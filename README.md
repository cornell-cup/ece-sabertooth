## Synopsis

This project is developed for the Intel-Cornell Cup, by Cornell students for the ModBot V2 Project in the Spring of 2016. The project is developed in C and is meant to be run on an Intel Edison. The Intel Edison communicates through UART with two Sabertooth 2x25 (or 2x12) motor controllers and a Kangaroo V2 in order to drive 4 brushed motors for the ModBot V2 platform.
